Intro to javascript with parallax scrolling workshop files
<br>
Using final-parallax.html as a guide, complete the start-parallax.html file. <br>
For beginners, I recommend downloading and installing 'Brackets' an easy to use code editor with a built in live preview.<br>
Right click on your file and select 'open with' and choose brackets.<br>
In the upper righthand corner of the program click the lightningbolt icon.<br>
This will initiate a live preview session in a new chrome browser.
